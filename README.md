# Pet-Protector
This userscript protects your favorite Neopets from misclicks that could cause accidental color/species changes, conversion, and abandonment. It's not a security feature; it just helps to prevent user error! :)

Just edit the PETNAME fields in the script to reflect the names of the pets you want to protect. Names can be added or removed as necessary.

**This script:**

1. Hides your favorite pets at the Lab Ray, Rainbow Fountain, Pound, and Item Use Screen Dropdown Menu (only when a potentially dangerous item is being used).
2. Removes the Unconverted Pet Notice from the Quick Reference page.

**Note:** This script will hide pets from the item use screen whenever *any* item with the word "Magical" in its name is being used. If you want to use a non-dangerous "Magical" item on one of your favorite pets, you will have to disable the script. This is just so the script doesn't have to list every single Magical Plushie and Magical Chia Pop!
